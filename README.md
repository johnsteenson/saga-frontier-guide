# SaGa Frontier Guide

This is an interactive guide to navigating the mechanics of SaGa Frontier.  You can see this in action here: http://saga-frontier-guide.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/

SaGa Frontier is a very complex game with layers of opaque rules.  This tool allows you to quickly look up which
skills a character has a specific talent for, which skills are most likely to spark from others, and experiment with
which skills can combo together.

This is a fun hobby project I did to help myself navigate determining which skills to get for the characters I had.  If
you'd like to contribute, feel free.  You are welcome to use any of this code in your own projects as well.
